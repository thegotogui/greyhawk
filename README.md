# Preparation for Next Meeting

Before our next meeting, we want to share a few things with you to help you learn more about our work and how we engage with the global Python community. These will help you prepare for our next meeting, both to answer some questions you may have for us and to show us what insights you may gain from your review. 

**You do not need to review all of these materials: spend as much time on them as you think is necessary.**

When you've reviewed this information, take a look at the questions at the [end of this page](#questions-to-consider). Bring your thoughts to our next meeting.

## About Us

### James' Speaking Engagements
This is one of James's most popular talks: "[So you want to be a Python Expert?](https://youtu.be/7lmCu8wz8ro)"

James has given many talks at Python conferences and meetup groups around the world, but this remains one of his most oft-cited; this video has been referenced in textbooks and university curricula. A long (but still incomplete!) list of James's talks is available at [PyVideo.org](https://pyvideo.org/speaker/james-powell.html), where he's currently the 2nd-most prolific speaker they have listed... but we are certain that he ought to be the 1st, so a medium-term goal is to find and collect the videos that they DON'T have listed and see if they'll update their page. 

## Platform Goals

### Social Media
When our company was first starting up, we mainly used James' Twitter account, [@DontUseThisCode](https://twitter.com/dontusethiscode), which has over 10K followers. Currently, we have an official company Twitter with almost 400 followers, [@DUTC_Training](https://twitter.com/dutc_training). As Do(n't) Use This Code grows as a company, we're working to build up the official platforms in addition to the following that James has collected.

### Newsletter
Our newsletter, [DUTC Weekly](https://us19.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=01b4897fda429b368f040dc8a&id=508aba34a0), has nearly 500 subscribers. This platform allows us to send longer-form Python content to our readers. We hope to continue to build this platform as well as establish a blog with overlapping content.

### Video
When Daniel, our Media Director, joined us in February, we started to produce more polished video assets for marketing. Now, we are gearing up to properly launch our YouTube channel later this year. Here's just one exampleâ€”this 1.5 minute snippet was used to promote one of the recent "B2C" classes we held this year: ["Is .groupby.apply worth it?](https://youtu.be/DxSmbQ3pQRI)"


### Charitable Contributions
Finally, in December 2020, we held a [Telethon/Charity Livestream](https://youtu.be/gzbmLeaM8gs) to benefit NumFOCUS, the nonprofit organization that supports the development of many tools in the Python ecosystem, and for which James serves as Vice President and Chairman of the Board of Directors. 


**NOTE:** This video is over four hours long, so you definitely don't need to sit and watch the whole thing! We plan to run additional telethons like this in 2021 and beyond, which will allow us to expand our sponsorship of Python conferences and other community engagements. These efforts will definitely be something that the person filling the Marketing role will be heavily involved with. 

## Questions to Consider
Here are some questions we'd like you to review. Please select some of the following to ponder, and we'll discuss them during our next meeting:

* Given the information above, what would you consider to be our highest-priority item? For example, should we build a more complete video library first, and then a social media awareness strategy around it? Or should we begin with social media to build awareness, and then resolve the video content issue? (Note that there is no right or wrong answer. We want to hear what you think.)
* One of our core principles is professionalism. We compare our training approach (both in terms of content and delivery) to the difference between "to go" coffee in a paper cup from a national chain versus formal tea service in the lobby of a boutique hotel. In other words, both the product and the service that supports it are "high-end." How and where else might we deliver this "experience"? How can we make all aspects of interacting with DUTC feel formal, professional, and unique for each client?
* How might you go about motivating the 10k followers on James' Twitter account to also follow our company account? Are there incentives you can think of that would help with the transition?
* How would you suggest we integrate existing content (e.g., James' talks and Twitter posts) with our current public platforms? Which platforms do you believe are best suited for this?
* While we aim for the highest quality Python training on the market, who do you believe is our greatest competition? What is the best way to distinguish ourselves from them, both on our public platforms and with our private corporate clients? What advantages/disadvantages do we face when doing so?
* One of our biggest clients is interested in doing an additional class with us at the end of the year, but they're not sure if they'll have the budget for it and, if they do, whether or not they'll choose to spend it with us. How would you handle this situation?

Thank you! We look forward to speaking with you soon!
